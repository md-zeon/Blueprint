  },
  {
    q: "Which authentication methods are supported?",
    a: "Acme supports email and password, magic-link sign-in, Google OAuth, and SAML SSO for enterprise plans. Two-factor authentication is available on all tiers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I export my data at any time?",
    a: "Yes. From your account settings you can request a full JSON export of all your projects, assets, and activity logs. Exports are processed within minutes and delivered to your registered email.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when I reach my storage limit?",
    a: "You will receive email alerts at 80% and 95% usage. Once the limit is reached, uploads are paused until you upgrade your plan or remove existing files.",

    q: "Is there a sandbox environment for testing?",
    a: "Every workspace includes a Sandbox environment that mirrors production but never affects live data. API calls made in Sandbox are free and excluded from your usage quota.",

    q: "How are API rate limits enforced?",
    a: "Requests are metered per minute and per day at the workspace level. Exceeding either threshold returns a 429 response with a Retry-After header indicating when capacity resets.",

    q: "Do you offer SLA guarantees?",

  {
    q: "How do I contact support?",
